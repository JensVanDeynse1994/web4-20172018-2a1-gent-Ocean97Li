# Project iShareEconomy
This website will aim to implement a new, self-designed system of share-economy based on existing share economy ideas.
The ultimate goal of this project is to cut the cost of daily life, stop over-consumption, protect the enviroment and above all reconect neighbourhoods and form trusting and sharing communities!
